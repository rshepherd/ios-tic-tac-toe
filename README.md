TicTacToe
=========

A hacky little implementation of Tic Tac Toe; an exercise in learning the basics of iOS development using storyboards. 

The code is pretty awful, but I banged this out in just a few hours.

This is in no way intended to be a commercial product. I used a few images from the internet that I certainly don't own. 
If they are yours and you dissaprove, just let me know.
